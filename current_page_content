We are Insights Hive
What we do
We are focused on FMCG and CPG companies, utilizing the power of AI computer vision to solve the following
Challenge
A thorough solution is missing for FMCG and CPG companies that provides accurate and up-to-date KPIs:

OOS (Out of Stock)
SOS (Share of Shelf)
Planogram Compliance
and
Second Point of Sales

Why we are doing this
We strongly believe that AI technology can bring significant value to companies that are not in the tech industry
Our solution delivers SOS, OOS, Planogram Compliance, and Second Point of Sales faster and in a much more efficient way than manual methods of collecting these leading indicators
Today, companies in the industry spend more than 30 minutes capturing SOS, OOS, and Planogram Compliance data from retailers
We aim to reduce this time to just 5 minutes by simply taking a photo or a short video
